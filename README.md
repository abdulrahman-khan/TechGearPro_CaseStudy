# TechGearPro Background
Founded in 2018, **TechGear Pro is a rapidly expanding e-commerce retailer specializing in high-quality computer peripherals.** We offer a comprehensive range of products, including keyboards, mice, monitors, and other essential tech gear. The company aims to leverage advanced data analysis to extract insights from its extensive inventory and sales data. These findings will uncover new business opportunities and guide strategic decisions for the company's future growth.

## Project Overview
The company has a core dataset consisting of orders, order statuses, customers, products, and geographic information. Their data is quite messy and contains plenty of insights that have not yet been discovered by the company. The company has hired a team of Data Analysts to partner with their head of operations to deliver insights to teams across the company, including finance, sales, product and marketing. **The focus of this project is the help the stakeholders understand TechGearPros' performance so they can adjust their day-to-day processes and help the company deliver top-notch products to customers around the world.**

The Data Analyst team has identified the general data structure and drew up an entity relationship diagram to aid in the data processing and analysis for the duration of the project.

## Summary of Initial Insights
From 2019 to 2022, the company has accumulated over 100k sales records. After cleaning and processing the data, the team of analysts has some interesting initial insights to share. 

The average annual sales reached 21K orders with a yearly sales of $5 million and an average order value of $227. 2021 saw the highest number of sales orders (36,000) while 2020 showed the highest average order value ($300 per order). Looking into the seasonal trends, the company sees a holiday surge in sales each year, notibly in November and December which see an 18%-23% increace in average order value. "Apple Airpods Headphones" consistently ranked as the best-selling product, and in 2022, the top three products accounted for 70% of sales. The Bose Headphones had the lowest number of sales across most years. 

Non-loyalty members have made up over double the sales in both 2019 and 2020, but that gap is closing as more and more people join the loyalty program. Loyalty members made up over half the sales for the first time in 2020. Loyalty members spend more on average, and purchase more expensive items compared to the non-loyalty members. The team recommends to continue to the loyaty program, as the treds indicate the loyalty customers could contribute to majority of the company sales in the coming future.
