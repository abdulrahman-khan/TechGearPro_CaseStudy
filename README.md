# TechGearPro Background
Founded in 2018, **TechGear Pro is a rapidly expanding e-commerce retailer specializing in high-quality computer peripherals.** We offer a comprehensive range of products, including keyboards, mice, monitors, and other essential tech gear. The company aims to leverage advanced data analysis to extract insights from its extensive inventory and sales data. These findings will uncover new business opportunities and guide strategic decisions for the company's future growth.

## Project Overview
The company has a core dataset consisting of orders, order statuses, customers, products, and geographic information. Their data is quite messy and contains plenty of insights that have not yet been discovered by the company. The company has hired a team of Data Analysts to partner with their head of operations to deliver insights to teams across the company, including finance, sales, product and marketing. **The focus of this project is the help the stakeholders understand TechGearPros' performance so they can adjust their day-to-day processes and help the company deliver top-notch products to customers around the world.**

The Data Analyst team has identified the general data structure and drew up an entity relationship diagram to aid in the data processing and analysis for the duration of the project.
